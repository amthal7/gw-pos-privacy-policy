    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> March 18, 2025</p>

    <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to <strong>GW Gateway</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data, permissions, and security measures within the app.</p>
    <p><strong>GW Gateway</strong> is a merchant-focused application that allows authorized users to purchase telecom recharge e-vouchers using an internal wallet system. The app does not support user sign-up, external wallet top-ups, or third-party transactions.</p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p><strong>GW Gateway does not collect, store, or share any personal data.</strong> The app operates within a closed merchant network and does not require user registration.</p>
    <p>However, the app may process certain data to ensure proper functionality:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Transaction History:</strong> Logs in-app purchases for internal accounting and reporting.</li>
        <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> May collect basic device identifiers to prevent unauthorized access and ensure security.</li>
    </ul>

        <li><strong>Notifications:</strong> Used to send transaction alerts and important updates.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>These permissions are used solely for operational purposes and are not shared with third parties.</p>

    <h2>4. How We Use Data</h2>
    <p>The data processed within GW Gateway is used strictly for operational purposes:</p>

        <li>Facilitating secure transactions within the internal merchant network.</li>
        <li>Ensuring fraud prevention and security compliance.</li>
        <li>Improving the reliability and performance of the app.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Data Retention & Security</h2>
    <p>GW Gateway does not permanently store any sensitive user data. Transaction logs are retained for internal accounting and fraud prevention, following strict security protocols.</p>
    <p>All data is processed within a secure environment and is never shared with third-party entities.</p>

    <h2>6. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <p>Authorized merchants using the app are responsible for:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Keeping their login credentials secure and confidential.</li>
        <li>Ensuring transactions are performed in a secure manner.</li>
        <li>Reporting any suspicious activity to the company.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Access</h2>

    <h2>8. Compliance with Laws</h2>
    <p>GW Gateway complies with applicable data protection and privacy laws. Since the app does not collect personal information, it does not fall under consumer data protection regulations such as GDPR or CCPA.</p>
