  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>GW Voucher</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data, permissions, and security within the app.</p>
  <p><strong>GW Voucher</strong> is a merchant-focused application provided by Alamthal Co. at no cost and is intended for use as-is. The app allows authorized users to access and manage telecom voucher services through a secure internal system.</p>

  <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p><strong>GW Voucher does not collect, store, or share any personal data directly.</strong> The app operates within a closed merchant network and does not require user registration.</p>

  </ul>
  <p>This technical data is not shared externally and is used only for internal operations and diagnostics.</p>

  <h2>3. App Permissions</h2>
  <p>The app may request access to the following permissions solely for operational purposes. No data is used for advertising or profiling.</p>

  <h3>3.5 Notification Access</h3>

  <h2>4. Cookies</h2>
  <p>This app does not use cookies directly. However, integrated third-party services (such as analytics or logging tools) may use cookies to enhance performance. Users can manage cookie preferences through device settings.</p>

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The app may use trusted third-party providers to enable essential features, such as:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Crash reporting and diagnostics</li>
    <li>Bluetooth printing support</li>
    <li>Security and performance analytics</li>
  </ul>
  <p>These services may collect limited technical information (e.g., device type, error data) strictly for supporting the app. They are contractually prohibited from using the data for any unrelated purpose.</p>

  <h2>6. Data Retention & Security</h2>
  <p>Only operational data required for fraud detection and accounting is retained. No personal data is stored long-term or shared for marketing.</p>
  <p>We use industry-standard practices to secure all processed data. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission is completely secure.</p>
