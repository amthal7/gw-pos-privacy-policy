  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>Welcome to <strong>GW Voucher</strong>. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle data, permissions, and security measures within the app.</p>
  <p><strong>GW Voucher</strong> is a merchant-focused application provided by Alamthal Co. at no cost and is intended for use as-is. The app allows authorized users to access and manage telecom voucher services through a secure internal system.</p>

    <li>Support printing, analytics, or crash/error reporting</li>
    <li>Assist in improving app performance</li>
